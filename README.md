Environmental variables
For now we have heard what is the virtual environment. But what are those Environmental variables and what problems do they solve?

To put simply, we can use them as a form of configuration or storing sensitive data: IPs, credentials, anything else that we do not have exposed in our git project for others to see. We could also use predefine some Environmental variables in GitHub, GitLab, etc. for automated pipelines.
